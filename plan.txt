1. confirm that backend is fully implemented and works
2. implement web scraper and have it funnel information to the backend database
    - this maybe needs to run like once a month or something
3. learn frontend languages and make frontend to interact with backend
    - right now I want this to be a single page with two tables each representing a car
    - the user can use a dropdown or something to pick each car they want to compare
        - then each car is pulled from the database and each table is populated
4. deploy to the cloud
