1. Confirm all desired business logic is implemented and works as intended
    - write tests for all this stuff
    - confirm all errors are handled
2. add tests for endpoints
3. Add security
4. Connect to PostgreSQL databse with Docker
5. Create a bunch of data to use in the real site, probably create a spreadsheet, figure out how to implant it into program
6. Design frontend if time, if not use Swagger UI
7. Deploy to AWS free tier
8. Add very detailed README on github

Considerations before deploying:
- Making sure passwords are private
- Making sure API keys are private

NEW PLAN
1. Make sure all passwords and api key are private
2. Design frontend
3. Switch security to be configured for having a frontend
4. Put backend and frontend into containers
5. Deploy to cloud providor
6. Write README and verify nothing sensitive is on GitHub
